# Codex CLI Installation

In order to leverage the Codex CLI tool, you will need to prepare your environment for the shell of your choice.
Installation instructions are shown below for each supported shell environment.

The following terminal environments are supported:

* [Powershell](#powershell-instructions)
* [Bash](#bash-instructions)
* [Zsh](#zsh-instructions) (or [Bash 5.1](#bash-instructions))

Learn to install PowerShell on Linux/macOS
[here](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell).

## Prerequisites

In order to run the Codex CLI, ensure that you have python installed. To install the required python packages, please go
to the command line in the shell of your choice and enter the following commands:

```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Additionally, the OpenAI API key, organization id, and model id are required to execute the Codex CLI tool.

To obtain the OpenAI API key information, go to (https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and login into your
account.

Once logged in you will see:

Copy the API key by clicking the _Copy_ button and save the copied key where you can retrieve it.

To obtain the OpenAI organization id, go to OpenAI Settings page (https://platform.openai.com/account/org-settings) and
copy the id shown underneath the _Organization ID_ heading. Save the copied id with the API key that was stored in
previous step.

To obtain the OpenAI model id, go to OpenAI Models page (https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) for the models
available for Chat models. Select the desired model and save the model id with the API key and organization id stored in
previous steps.

## Bash instructions

To leverage the Codex CLI on WSL and Linux environments using Bash please follow the steps below:

1. Open Bash shell and download the Codex CLI project to your desired location in Linux by cloning the Codex CLI repo
   using the following command:
    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/microsoft/Codex-CLI.git /your/custom/path/
    ```

2. Once you have the project cloned. Go to the directory that contains the Codex CLI code.
    ```
	cd </your/custom/path>/Codex-CLI
    ```

3. Setup your Bash Codex CLI environment.

   In the Codex CLI folder, there is a folder named `scripts` where you will find a `bash_setup.sh` script which is used
   to set up the Bash environment.

   Run the following commands to set up your environment, the script will prompt
   for Organization id, API key and model id:
   ```
   cd scripts
   source bash_setup.sh
   ```

   The script will create an OpenAI config file and update your bash environment.

4. Open a new Bash terminal. Type in `#` followed by your natural language request. Press `Ctrl + G` to execute!

### Clean up

Once you have finished using the Codex CLI tool, go to the folder that contains the Codex CLI code.
ex `cd ~/your/custom/path/Codex-CLI`. Run the following command to clean up the Codex CLI bash environment.

```
source ./scripts/bash_cleanup.sh
```

Once done, close the terminal session.

### About bash_setup.sh

By default `bash_setup.sh` will prompt for the required settings. It's also possible to pass these values from the
command line, using the following parameters:
